SQlite
    no separate server, its all local
    FASTER
    speak python to our database! You are relying on the ORM to do the queries
    you can still do rawSQL. to do other queries

from django.db import models
from __future__import unicode_literals
#create your models here
# you need to start writing your class

class User(models.Model):
    first_name = model.CharField(max.length = 45)
    created_at = model.DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True)



    ONE HUGE DIFFERENCE
    before when we were using mySQL, lets say we had a many to many relationship for posts, you
    automatically got a foriegn key. EVERYTHING will get an id by default for user

    YOU DONT NEED TO SPEND TIME MAKING JOINS ON USER ID for django

    Do a class of post

    class Post(models.model):
        user = tell it what class will come in here so....
        user = models.ForeignKey(User) NOT THE USER ID, BUT IT MAKES AN INSTANCE OF EVERYTHING THAT USER HAS
