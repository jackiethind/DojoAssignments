MVC
Model View Controller
In order to make code easier to organize, by modularizing our code
Ppl wrote scrolls, but then ppl made books, organize things into chapters and pages
makes organizing and splitting up tasks easier

Views / Templates (Django)
HTML, what the user sees
Button <--submits request

Controller/ Views(Django)
handles routing, receives request from views
..going to figure out your routes for you
tells model what we need
sends information taken from model to the views

Model
in charge of taking to the database, all your sql queries go here
validate inputs (email validations!)
fetch information from database
delivers back to the controller, not to the views

MVC is actually MTV now, you can divide your entire website into separate apps
You have an app called login and registration, eventually u want to visit a new page once
ive logged in. I should have access to different functionality.
