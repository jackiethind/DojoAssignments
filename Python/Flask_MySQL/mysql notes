MYSQL Notes
Python should handle functionality by default not JQUERY

The new language of databases
we need to know how to navigate the request response from server to database

SQL
mySQL is built on SQL
Postgress, Oracle, noSQL (not only SQL)

SQL Structured Query Language
    relational database management system (rdbms)
        tables talk to each other
    GOALS
        do not repeat data
            here are some rules for this
                1.) each column has 1 value
                    break Amy Giver into columns under first name and last name
                    what about address?
                        street & city & state & zipcode
                2.) each column should be unique, name them with underscores between words
                    movies table for finding nemo = animated(1) cartoon(2) family(3) pixar - assign keys to everything, holding 20 characters is harder than holding onto a number key
                    movies              genre
                    ____________________________
                    1. finding nemo     1
                    1. finding nemo     2
                    1. finding nemo     3
                3.) non key should not be dependent on other non key columns
                    Movies
                    id              name           theater             theater city
                    _____________________________________________________________________
                    1               finding nemo   century 16          Mtn View
                    (primary key)                  ^
                                                   |____non keys but dependent on each other (this is bad if you change the theater because you also have to change the theater city)

                    Theaters
                    id          theater         city            so lets assign a key to the theater and its city
                    ------------------------------------
                    1           century 16      Mtn View <----- here it is a primary key in its own table.

                    Movies
                    id              name           theater
                    _____________________________________________________________________
                    1               finding nemo   2 <------this key is a foriegn key now because it being pulled from another table



    you can assign keys to one table and then pull the key from it to another table
    how do you know which tables are talking to each other
    we need to make connections between tables
    we use relational mapping because we do not want to repeat data
QUERY = Question, but thats not what it means in database world. it means REQUEST
    = making a request
        you need to learn how to speak SQL to make these requests from the database
        THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE LEARNING HOW TO DO
ERD = our friends :) they stand for entity relationship diagram
        great way to start designing a database, your way to visualize what your database looks like
        its a visualization tool! ooo i like
        Use this to construct and plan the DB
        in order to understand which tables are talking to which, we will draw out the relationships to visualize the mapping

    1:1 relationship
        users
        -------------------------------------------
        id      first name      last name   email
        --------------------------------------------

        2           fjdlajf@fdaw.com

        these ids are for, every table should have its own unique identifier (id column)

MYSQL Workbench
    schemas mean your database
    enter querys with a semicolon!
    command enter and it will run for you
    if you use semicolons, you can seperate
    use world(schemas): first query
    select * (all) from cities: second query
    move cursor to the one i want to run

    you can also filter countries
    select * from countries WHERE id=159:


Normalization = convention in database design to make our data more concise and make sure we dont repeat data \
