    Not on Platform
    How does JS run?
        interpreter(browser) understands and runs code.
            runs in 2 steps
                1.parsing = goes through each line, code will change a little bit
                    "hoisting"
                    declare all variables at the top of your document to avoid weird parsing errors?
                    syntax errors = failure while parsing, tells you what line it is, and what character is wrong/confused
                        YOUR CODE HASNT RUN YET!
                2.runtime
                    just looks at code, converts to machine language, and then performs actions
                    100% YOUR FAULT
                console.log() is awesome, will run on that line. we want to use it to debug and see how your variable is changing.
        Node is a javascript interpreter

    for ninja you need this, think of swapping, use temp
